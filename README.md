Byron Encinas Profile
==========================================================================================
I'm a physicist with the intention to navigate the software engineering path.
Here I shall put to test my own knowledge of several lagnauges through projects.

#### My main line of focus are the following languages:

- Python for data analysis and automation.
- Fortran for precise and powerful physics calculations.
- C/C++/Rust (don't know yet which one).
- SQL is on the run, but not quite there yet.
